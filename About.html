        <p class="lead">
         Sofia Enriquez( Im a student-athlete at La Salle University, majoring in Communications with minors in Digital Art (DART) and Sports Management. Im also a member of the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee (SAAC) and serve as a Morgans Message Ambassador, advocating for mental health awareness in sports.
Photography has been part of my life for as long as I can remember. What started as a casual hobby  capturing family moments, nature, and random details  grew into one of my favorite ways to tell stories. Over time, I realized that photography isnt just about documenting what I see; its about expressing how I feel and how I experience the world around me.

        </p>

I m drawn to everyday scenes that many people might overlook  the way light hits a building at a certain hour, reflections on glass, or the quiet beauty hidden in a busy street. When I visited New York City for the first time, it felt like stepping into a living museum  full of movement, contrasts, and stories. Through my photos, I try to capture that energy and authenticity: the blend of the grand and the ordinary that defines real life.
My approach is intuitive. I rarely plan what Im going to shoot; I follow my instincts and try to catch the emotion of a moment before it fades. I believe the most powerful photos are the ones that make people pause  not because theyre perfect, but because they tell a story that feels true.
