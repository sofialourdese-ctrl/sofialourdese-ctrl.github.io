          In the summer of 2024, I visited New York City for the first time. For years I would imagined it through movies and books the yellow taxis, crowded streets, coffee cups, and glass towers  but being there felt completely different. The city was alive: louder, brighter, faster, and more human than I ever expected. Every corner had a pulse, every crowd moved like waves, and every building seemed to tell a story.
I carried my camera everywhere, capturing both the obvious and the unnoticed, like a musician by the subway, sunlight on brick walls, a strangers laughter. I wanted to freeze the moments that made me feel something, the ones that reminded me I was living a dream Id long imagined.
Photography has always been part of who I am. What draws me in isnt just the image, but the emotion behind it a sound, a smell, a fleeting mood. A photograph can hold honesty in ways words cant, and that honesty is what I love most.
This portfolio reflects how I experienced New York  not as a tourist, but as someone seeing it with wonder. Through images of architecture, streets, and people, I tried to show what the city feels like: fast yet timeless, chaotic yet beautiful. These photos arent just memories; theyre pieces of a journey that will stay with me long after I left.
